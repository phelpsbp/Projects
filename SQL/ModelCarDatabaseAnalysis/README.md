# ModelCarDatabaseAnalysis

Analyze Data in a Model Car Database with MySQL Workbench - A collection of SQL queries to validate suggestions for inventory reduction. 

Mint Classics Company is hoping to close one of their storage facilities. They want suggestions and recommendations for reorganizing or reducing inventory, while still maintaining timely service to their customers. 
My task is to conduct exploratory analysis to investigate if there are any patterns or themes that may influence the reduction or reorganization of inventory in the Mint Classics storage facilities.
