# Cyclistic Bike-Share Case Study
**Google Capstone Project: Cyclistic Bike-Share Case Study**

In this case study, I am a junior data analyst on the Marketing Analytics Team for a company named Cyclistic Bike-Share. I have been assigned the analysis of historical bike trip data in order to identify trends. Using those trends, I am tasked to produce compelling data and professional data visualizations with insights and recommendations for marketing strategies to convert casual riders to annual members for future revenue and growth.

### Tools

- Excel - Data Cleaning
- Google BigQuery - Data Analysis
- PowerBI - Dashboard


### Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Handling missing values.
3. Data cleaning and formatting.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as:

- What is the overall sales trend?
- Which products are top sellers?
- What are the peak sales periods?

### Data Analysis

Include some interesting code/features worked with

```sql
SELECT * FROM table1
WHERE cond = 2;
```

### Results/Findings

The analysis results are summarized as follows:
1. The company's sales have been steadily increasing over the past year, with a noticeable peak during the holiday season.
2. Product Category A is the best-performing category in terms of sales and revenue.
3. Customer segments with high lifetime value (LTV) should be targeted for marketing efforts.

### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:
- Invest in marketing and promotions during peak sales seasons to maximize revenue.
- Focus on expanding and promoting products in Category A.
- Implement a customer segmentation strategy to target high-LTV customers effectively.

### Limitations

I had to remove all zero values from budget and revenue columns because they would have affected the accuracy of my conclusions from the analysis. There are still a few outliers even after the omissions but even then we can still see that there is a positive correlation between both budget and number of votes with revenue.
